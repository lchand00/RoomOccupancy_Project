# RoomOccupancy_Project

  Person detection using non-intrusive sensors is a popular approach for occupancy estimation in IoT devices. In this project, we explore using non-intrusive sensors, including temperature, light, CO2, and humidity, for occupancy estimation in a room. We use the Room Occupancy Estimation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information on temperature, light, humidity, CO2 levels, and occupancy in a room. 

  We explore different machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees and Random Forests, to predict occupancy based on sensor data. We also design an IoT system to monitor occupancy in a room using non-intrusive sensors, including controllers, gateways, and cloud services. Our team overcomes challenges related to sensor placement and data transmission through collaboration and experimentation. Finally, we discuss using deep learning methods, including Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory cells, for occupancy estimation in IoT devices. Our project provides insights into the design and implementation of IoT systems for occupancy estimation using non-intrusive sensors.
