# RoomOccupancy_Project
  Person detection using non-intrusive sensors is a popular approach for occupancy estimation in IoT devices. In this project, we explore using non-intrusive sensors, including temperature, light, CO2, and humidity, for occupancy estimation in a room. We use the Room Occupancy Estimation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information on temperature, light, humidity, CO2 levels, and occupancy in a room. 

Packages used:

1. pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
2. numpy: for numerical computing and array operations
3. scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms, model selection, and evaluation metrics
4. keras: for building and training deep learning models
5. matplotlib: for data visualization and plotting
6. seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
