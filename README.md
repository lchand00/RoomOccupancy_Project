# RoomOccupancy_Project

  Person detection using non-intrusive sensors is a popular approach for occupancy estimation in IoT devices. In this project, we explore using non-intrusive sensors, including temperature, light, CO2, and humidity, for occupancy estimation in a room. We use the Room Occupancy Estimation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information on temperature, light, humidity, CO2 levels, and occupancy in a room.
